# People exchange commodities in markets. Each market focuses on certain
# commodity pair `{A, B}`. By convention, we call people exchange A for B
# *sellers* who submit *ask* orders, and people exchange B for A *buyers*
# who submit *bid* orders.
#
# ID of market is always in the form "#{B}#{A}". For example, in 'btcusd'
# market, the commodity pair is `{btc, usd}`. Sellers sell out _btc_ for
# _usd_, buyers buy in _btc_ with _usd_. _btc_ is the `base_unit`, while
# _usd_ is the `quote_unit`.
#
# Given market BTCUSD.
# Ask/Base currency/unit = BTC.
# Bid/Quote currency/unit = USD.

  # == Constants ============================================================

  # Since we use decimal with 16 digits fractional part for storing numbers in DB
  # sum of multipliers fractional parts must not be greater then 16.
  # In the worst situation we have 3 multipliers (price * amount * fee).
  # For fee we define static precision - 6. See TradingFee::FEE_PRECISION.
  # So 10 left for amount and price precision.
